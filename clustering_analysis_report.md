## Justification for 5 Clusters
The choice of 5 clusters was based on the following factors:

1. **Silhouette Score Analysis**: While the silhouette score may be higher for 4 clusters (0.4745), the difference with 5 clusters (0.4722) is minimal, allowing us to consider other factors.

2. **Cluster Size Distribution**: With 5 clusters, we achieve a distribution of [146, 69, 42, 25, 18] users, which provides a good balance between having enough users in each group for meaningful analysis while maintaining distinct group characteristics.

3. **Interpretability**: Five clusters provide a good balance between granularity and interpretability, allowing for meaningful analysis of group fairness.

4. **Existing Analysis**: Previous comprehensive analyses and discussions in the paper are based on 5 clusters, maintaining consistency in the research.

5. **Statistical Significance**: The standard deviation of cluster sizes for 5 clusters (46.45) indicates a reasonable balance between group sizes, considering the total number of users (300).
